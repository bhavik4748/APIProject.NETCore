.NET Core API Project

For DB updates use following command to update migrations  in package manager console :  Add-Migration Initial
For running migrations in console :  Update-Database


This Project has 3 entities : 
1. Employee : Employee Id, Employee Name
2. State : State Id, State Name
3. Workflow : Workflow Id, State Id, EmployeeId, StartDate, EndDate


   I have added CRUD Api to update all above entities.
